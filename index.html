        <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
        <p><i>BareBones RPG</i>, players possess attributes, each associated with a specific number of six-sided dice for actions related to that attribute. Rolling a 5 on a die is a <b>soft success</b>, while a roll of 6 is a <strong>critical success</strong>. Any result below 4 is a <b>soft failure</b>, and a roll of 1 is a <strong>fumble</strong>, potentially leading to harmful consequences. However, if a player holds their action for a round or wants to react to an enemy's action, the success threshold is reduced to 4, instead of the usual 5-6.</p>
