#### A fast-paced six-sided dice system for TTRPG with rules and mechanics.

## Game Mechanics

In this game, players have attributes, and each attribute is associated with a specific number of **six-sided** dice they will roll when attempting an action related to that attribute. A roll of 5 on a die is considered a soft success, while a roll of 6 is a critical success. Any result below 5 is considered a soft failure, and if a player rolls a 1, it's considered a fumble, resulting in potentially harmful consequences. Unless, player holds their action for a round or want to react to an enemy's action this can bring the success treshold down to **4**, instead of 5-6.

## Character Creation

### Rolling for Stats

Players who prefer to roll for their stats can roll 1d6 and subtract 1d6 to determine their stat results. These stats results are in order: **MIGHT, MOBILITY, INSIGHT, GRIT, and ESSENCE**. The player cannot roll for that particular save, combat, or check if any stat result is zero. The player may sacrifice an attribute by subtracting 2 points and adding those points to any zero attributes.

### Customization Through Attribute Allocation

Stats can offer players flexibility when rolling dice. Each player begins with 8 points to allocate to any attribute in this game. Each attribute must have a minimum value of 1. This game grants players the freedom to create a character swiftly or discuss with the game master (GM) to shape their character.

BareBones uses these Attributes:

- **MIGHT**= _Crush, lift, strike, grapple_
- **MOBILITY**= _Defend, balance, swim, flee_
- **INSIGHT**= _Perceive, aim, charm, smarts_
- **GRIT**= _Resist Poison/cold/heat, survive falling_
- **ESSENCE**= _Willpower, using relics/magic weapons, casting spells, rituals_

### Calculating Hit Points

In BareBones, the player will start with _10+ GRIT_ to generate max HP.

### How much can I hold?

The playable character can hold up to 9+ MIGHT slots. If they carry more than they can handle, they become encumbered. The player will move at half their speed, and every roll will be with Burden on their Mobility, check, and defense rolls. Unless they have one, their attribute will go down to zero.

### How Much Currency Do I Start With?

The player will roll **3d6 * 10** (_fantasy setting_) or **3d6 * 100** (_modern setting_) *money, gold, or credit*. The player can purchase their _starting gear, weapon, and armor_.

### Bones Luck

Players will begin with 3 Bones Luck. Bones luck can help change roll results:
- _Combat Roll_
- _Mobility Save_
- _Initiative Roll_
- _Save by a Bone (**Death Save**)_

Players can gain (BL) with every **fumble roll**. Unless the player uses the fumble as a _hold_ for a **burden roll**.

## Action and Movement

Player's turn: they can move up to 30 feet, attack, defend, or wait for a reaction. If the player uses double movement, they can move up to 60 feet. Then, the player will wait for the next round to attack.

- Whenever an attack is triggered, the player will use Might when a weapon has a close-range tag.
- Whenever an attack is triggered, the player will use Insight when a weapon has a mid or far range due to aiming.
- Whenever a defense is triggered, the player will use Mobility when wearing armor, including the worn armor tag.
- Whenever a player casts a spell, they will use Essence.
- Whenever a player is bitten by something. Or touch something poisonous, the PC will use GRIT to save.
- When a player moves, and **holds their action**. They can _lower the success threshold to 4_ due to waiting for that moment to act!

### Initiative Rules:

In a battle encounter, a designated player rolls a die on behalf of their group to determine the starting order. The player turns to initiate from the left side of the GM and progresses clockwise around the table.

- 1-3.... Enemies go first
- 4-6.... Players go first

#### Optional Initiative Rule:

Individual initiative can be utilized. Both the enemy and the player will roll a d6 + MOBILITY. The highest roll will determine the winner of the initiative. This roll will occur at the beginning of every turn.

#### Optional Initiative Rule:

GM may use a deck of cards and assign each player and enemy a card. The lowest or highest number on the card will go first. Follow from First to Last or Royalty to Peasant rules. If players get an Ace, they will always go first in battle.

- Cards Order From First to Last: **Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Joker**.
- Descending order is also an acceptable way to keep track of initiative.
- Or Royalty to Peasant setting: **Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and Joker**.

### Attack Roll

It is the player's turn, and they decide to go for an attack, depending on the type of weapon they may hold. They will then roll for their respective Attribute. Any time a player rolls a 5 or 6, the attack happens.

### Enemy's Turn

Enemies can move and attack or take cover. When attacking, the player must make a Defense roll. If the PC fails, then the attack occurs. On a roll of 1, the enemy crits the attack against PC.

### Roll a Mobility Save to Dodge an Attack

Players and NPCs about to be attacked will roll Mobility save against an upcoming attack. If the defender rolls a 6, they can avoid the attack and make a counterattack. On a 5, the defender successfully avoids the attack. If the defender rolls a 1, the attacker does a critical hit. A critical hit deals double the damage depending on what weapon they are holding. This will decrease the weaponâ€™s quality until the weapon is broken.

When the PC holds a shield, they will receive a +1 bonus towards their roll result for defense. If the roll ends with multiple 1s, the shield will break.

### The Rule of Failure and Success Roll with Multiple Dice

In BareBones RPG, players and enemies may roll more than 1 die. Success and failure rolls will differ in combat whenever multiple dice are rolled.

If 1s and 6s are rolled together, if there are more 6s than 1s, it is ruled a success. If there are more 1s than 6s on the single roll, it is ruled a fumble. This also applies to Spell Mishap.

## Aiding or Interfering

### Aiding

In cases where a player receives aid during a check, the rolling player gains a **+1 bonus** for each player who helps. This bonus can turn a roll of 4 into a successful roll of 5 with the help of additional players.

### Interfering

In scenarios where a player encounters interference during a check, the rolling player incurs a **-1 penalty** for each interfering player. This penalty can result in a successful roll of 5 turning into an unsuccessful roll of 4 due to the presence of interfering players.

## A Boost and Burden Roll

BareBones uses Boost and Burden. Boost is a +1 point die towards the attribute, increasing the number of dice that can be rolled on that turn. A Burden imposes a -1 penalty die on a player's roll, depending on what they are wearing or facing a creature's ability.

### Two-Weapon Fighter Rules:

A player who creates a two-weapon fighter will follow the Burden rule. The dominant hand will always roll with all attributes with no Burden. When attacking with the non-dominant hand, the player will roll with a Burden, losing 1 point from their MIGHT or INSIGHT if they use a small-range weapon on each hand.

## Burn Mechanic

Players can use their attributes to push their limit once a session using the burn action with the chosen attribute. Burn mechanics should only be used when the player succeeds in their roll. Players who critically fumble a roll cannot use the burn mechanic. The PC will not lose an Attribute point for the first time using Burn. However, if the player uses burn on the same attribute the second time, the player will lose 1 point. The third time, with the same attribute, the player will lose 2 points. They can recover their points while holding a critical success role or taking a few days to rest.

## Declare with Success

- **MIGHT:** Attribute can increase damage to MIGHT*2.
- **MOBILITY:** Attribute can be used to counterattack the enemy automatically.
- **INSIGHT:** Attribute can be burnt to boost your following action, like finding an enemy's weak point while aiming or outsmarting a person with charm.

## Declare and Shall Receive

- **GRIT:** Attribute can be used to cut half of the damage automatically.
- **ESSENCE:** Exponentially increases the target number, zone/area, damage, or healing done by magic.

## Death

BareBones is a dangerous game for PCs, with death being a possible outcome at the table. 0 means you are dying. A player can do an epic attack and automatically die after the epic attack. Or GM or Player can roll a death timer by rolling a d3. At the moment, the player goes over the x amount of rounds. If the PC is not handled with a medical kit or magic, the PC will roll a Saved By a Bone (Death Save).

## Saved By A Bone

A player may roll a Saved by a Bone. This is our death save. If you roll a 1, this means the PC is dead. 2-4, they are still bleeding out. 5 they save. 5 the PC will get up with (x) amount GRIT as their HP. 6 the PC will get (x)*2 GRIT as their HP.

## Weapon Tag

- **Small:** Takes 1 slot and does 1 dmg + (MIGHT/INSIGHT)
- **Medium:** Takes 2 slots and does 2 dmg + (MIGHT/INSIGHT)
- **Great:** Takes 3 slots and does 3 dmg + (MIGHT/INSIGHT)

If not rolling for damage, the player will use their MIGHT/INSIGHT as a bonus.

### Optional Rule

PC can roll for damage instead of automatically doing damage. They will use the damage bonus instead of the attribute points.

## Damage Bonuses

- Small weapons: Roll 2d6 lowest result, then add damage bonus
- Medium weapons: Roll 1d6 + damage bonus
- Great weapons: Roll 2d6 takes the highest result and then adds your damage bonus.

The PC damage bonus will be half of their attributes rounded down.

- 1 point in attributes = 0 bonus
- 2 points in attributes = 1 bonus
- 3 points in attributes = 1 bonus
- 4 points in attributes = 2 bonus
- 5 points in attributes = 2 bonus
- 6 points in attributes = 3 bonus

## Resting

When players are in a somewhat safe area, with no active encounter:

- The players can recover 1d6+GRIT health and regain Bones Luck to three. Whenever players eat a ration, they need to rest in a safe place with uninterrupted sleep.
- The players can eat rations and use their waterskin; this is taking a breather before going forward to their next stop. A player must declare a **Breather**; this way, the GM can allow the players to use their rations with a short rest. When the PCs do this, they can roll 1d3+GRIT health and will not recover Bones Luck.

## BareBones Spell Casting

Magic is accessible to anyone with points in their Essence attribute. To cast a spell, roll your Essence attribute; if you roll a 5 or 6, the spell will take effect. However, be cautious of those fumble rolls, as they may have unintended consequences for the spell-caster. If player fails to cast their spell, the gm can afflict damage or make the pressence of the players known to the guards or monsters. Keep in mind that magic is dangerous! Only a _**brave or a foolish**_ soul may try this mysterious arcane power without considering its effects or repercussions.

The GM may allow spells from other OSR books or resources. Conversion will be necessary to align with the mechanics of BareBones RPG.
