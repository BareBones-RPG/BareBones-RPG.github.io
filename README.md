## You Will Need...

- 3 to 6 players, with one acting as the Game Master, Facilitator, or Referee.
- Pencil.
- Barebones RPG's Character Sheet
- At least 3 to 6 six-sided dice.
- Tokens or figures to represent playable characters.
- Your Imagination.

## Game Mechanics

In **_BareBones RPG_**, players possess _attributes_, each associated with a specific number of **six-sided** dice for actions related to that attribute. Rolling a **5** on a die is a _soft success_, while a roll of **6** is a _critical success_. Any result below **4** is a _soft failure_, and a roll of **1** is a _fumble_, potentially leading to harmful consequences. However, if a player holds their **action for a round or wants to react** to an enemy's action, the success threshold is reduced to **4**, instead of the usual **5-6**.

## Character Creation

### Rolling for Stats

For players who enjoy rolling for their stats, there are two options:

Using a **Standard Six-sided Die** (1d6):

Roll a standard six-sided die (1d6). Divide the result by 2, rounding up if necessary.
Assign the rounded result to the corresponding stat in the order: **MIGHT, MOBILITY, INSIGHT, GRIT, and ESSENCE**.
> **Example:** Roll a _D6_ and get a 4. Divide 4 by 2 to get a result of 2 (rounded up), assigning it to the relevant stat.
> **Note:** If you are new to this, remember that a standard six-sided die is commonly referred to as a D6.

### For Dice Enthusiasts (Dice Goblins) with a Three-sided Die (1d3):

Use a three-sided die (1d3) for a straight roll down in order for **Might, Mobility, Insight, Grit, and Essence.**
> **Example:** Roll the three-sided die five times, assigning each result in order to the corresponding stat.

### Customization Through Attribute Allocation

Players begin with 10 or 12 points to allocate among their attributes, with each attribute having a minimum value of 1. This system provides the freedom to create a character quickly or collaborate with the game master (GM) for a more tailored character.

### Playable Backgrounds

Players will provide background information for their playable characters. When a situation arises and they engage in a conversation with the referee to convince him or her that their background applies to the roll, the referee can award them a boost for that roll.

**Example:**
Player: "My character, Marcus, grew up in the wilderness and learned survival skills from his father, who was a skilled hunter. So, when we're tracking this elusive creature through the forest, I think Marcus would have a boost due to having hunter in his background if I follow its tracks."

Referee: "Hmm, that makes sense. Alright, I'll give you a boost on your tracking roll."

**BareBones Attributes:**

- **MIGHT** = _Crush, lift, strike, grapple_
- **MOBILITY** = _Defend, balance, swim, flee_
- **INSIGHT** = _Perceive, aim, charm, smarts_
- **GRIT** = _Resist Poison/cold/heat, survive falling_
- **ESSENCE** = _Willpower, using relics/magic weapons, casting spells, rituals_

### Calculating Hit Points

In BareBones, the player will start with _10 + GRIT_ to generate max HP.

#### Optional Rule:

GM may allow _13+GRIT_ for a stronger hero. 

### How much can I hold?

The playable character can hold up to 9 + MIGHT slots. Carrying more than they can handle results in being encumbered. The player will move at half their speed, and every roll will be with Burden on their Mobility, check, and defense rolls. Unless they have one, their attribute will go down to zero.

### How Much Currency Do I Start With?

The player will roll **3d6 * 10** (_fantasy setting_) or **3d6 * 100** (_modern setting_) for money, gold, or credit. This currency can be used to purchase their _starting gear, weapon, and armor_.

### Bones Luck

Players will begin with **3 Bones Luck**. Bones Luck can help change roll results:

- _Combat Roll_
- _Mobility Save_
- _Initiative Roll_
- _Save by a Bone (Death Save)_

Players can gain Bones Luck with every **fumble roll**. Players cannot use BL with **fumble** roll on a _check, combat, save, and magic_. 

## Action and Movement

Player's turn: they can move up to 30 feet, attack, defend, or wait for a reaction. If the player uses double movement, they can move up to 60 feet. Then, the player will wait for the next round to attack.

- _Whenever an attack is triggered_, the player will use **Might** when a weapon has a close-range tag.
- _Whenever an attack is triggered_, the player will use **Insight** when a weapon has a mid or far range due to aiming.
- _Whenever a defense is triggered_, the player will use **Mobility** when wearing armor, including the worn armor tag.
- _Whenever a player casts a spell_, they will use **Essence**.
- _Whenever a player is bitten by something_ or touches something poisonous, the PC will use GRIT to save.
- _When a player moves and **holds their action**_, they can _lower the success threshold to 4_ due to waiting for that moment to act!

### Initiative Rules:

In a battle encounter, a designated player rolls a die on behalf of their group to determine the starting order. The player turns to initiate from the left side of the GM and progresses clockwise around the table.

- 1-3... **Enemies go first**
- 4-6... **Players go first**

#### Optional Initiative Rule:

You can use individual initiative if you like. Both the enemy and the player will roll a d6 + MOBILITY. The highest roll will determine the winner of the initiative. This roll will occur at the beginning of every turn.

#### Optional Initiative Rule:

The GM uses a deck of cards and assigns each player and enemy a card. The highest number on the card determines the turn order. 

- Royalty to Peasant setting: _**Colored Joker, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace and Black and White (B&W) Joker**_.

#### Joker Rules:

- Colored Joker: If a player or enemy draws a colored Joker, they can go first or choose when to take their turn.
- Black and White Joker: If a player or enemy draws a Black and White Joker, they will always go last.

### Attack Roll

It is the player's turn, and they decide to go for an attack, depending on the type of weapon they may hold. They will then roll for their respective Attribute. 

- Anytime a player rolls a 5 or 6, the attack happens.
- If a player rolls a 6, this is a critical hit. The player will do double the damage against the enemy. This attack will reduce the enemy's armor. The armor will reduce from a d8 >> d6 >> d4 >> d2 >> 0. 
- A player holds their **action for a round or wants to react** to an enemy's action. This can reduce the success threshold to **4** instead of **5-6** in normal circumstances.

### Enemy's Turn

Enemies can move and attack or take cover. When attacking, the player must make a **Mobility Save** roll. 

- If the PC fails, the attack occurs, and players will **roll damage reduction** if wearing armor. 
- **On a roll of 1** with their Mobility Save, the enemy crits their attack against the Player Character and they will **roll damage reduction** if wearing armor. This will reduce the **armor quality**. 

### Roll a Mobility Save to Dodge an Attack

Players and NPCs about to be attacked will roll Mobility save against an upcoming attack.

- If the defender rolls a 6, they can avoid the attack and make a free attack. This is not a critical attack.

  > **Designers' Note:**
  >
  > - This will count as a regular attack. Criticals only happen when the player does an attack roll. 

- On a 5, the defender successfully avoids the attack.

- On 4- roll, the player will be hit and need to roll for damage reduction depending on their armor. 

- The attacker does a critical hit if the defender rolls a 1. A critical hit deals double the damage depending on what they are wearing. This will decrease the armor’s quality until is broken.

When the PC holds a shield, it will negate a -1 damage when hit. If the roll ends with multiple 1s, the shield will break. The PC can ignore all damage from one attack but the shield breaks.

### The Rule of Failure and Success Roll with Multiple Dice

In BareBones RPG, players and enemies may roll more than 1 die. Success and failure rolls will differ in combat whenever multiple dice are rolled.

- If 1s and 6s are rolled together, if there are more 6s than 1s, it is ruled a success.
- If there are more 1s than 6s on the single roll, it is ruled a fumble. This also applies to Spell Mishap.

## Aiding or Interfering

### Aiding

In cases where a player receives aid during a check, the rolling player gains a **+1 bonus** for each player who helps. This bonus can turn a roll of 4 into a successful roll of 5 with the help of additional players.

> **Designer's Note:**
>
> - If this is a **social encounter** the GM or Player will roll a d6 for **NPC's Reaction** and add (+1 **per players who are aiding**)
> - If this is during a **combat** and a **Check** roll, the player will have to discuss how they will aid the player who is about to roll and the GM will decide if this aid makes sense and the GM can allow the +1 **bonus towards** their roll.

### Interfering

In scenarios where a player encounters interference during a check, the rolling player incurs a **-1 penalty** for each interfering player. This penalty can result in a successful roll of 5 turning into an unsuccessful roll of 4 due to the presence of interfering players.


## A Boost and Burden Roll

_BareBones_ uses **Boost and Burden** . 

- A **Boost** is a +1 die towards the attribute, increasing the number of dice that can be rolled on that turn.
- A **Burden** imposes a -1 penalty die on a player's roll, depending on what they are wearing and facing a creature's abilities.

### Two-Weapon Fighter Rules:

A player who creates a two-weapon fighter will follow the Burden rule. 

- The dominant hand will always roll with all attributes with no Burden.
- When attacking with the non-dominant hand, the player will roll with a Burden for their non-dominant hand attack, this can be MIGHT or INSIGHT depending on the type of weapon.

## Burn Mechanic

Players can use their attributes to push their limit once a session using the burn action with the chosen attribute. Burn mechanics should only be used when the player succeeds in their roll. Players who critically fumble a roll cannot use the burn mechanic. The PC will not lose an Attribute point for the first time using Burn. However, if the player uses burn on the same attribute the second time, the player will lose 1 point. The third time, with the same attribute, the player will lose 2 points. They can recover their points while holding a critical success role or taking a few days to rest.

## Declare with Success

- **MIGHT:** Attribute can increase damage to MIGHT*2.
- **MOBILITY:** Attribute can be used to counterattack the enemy automatically.
- **INSIGHT:** Attribute can be burnt to boost your following action, like finding an enemy's weak point while aiming or outsmarting a person with charm.

## Declare and Shall Receive

- **GRIT:** Attribute can be used to cut half of the damage automatically.
- **ESSENCE:** Exponentially increases the target number, zone/area, damage, or healing done by magic.

## Death

BareBones is a dangerous game for PCs, with death being a possible outcome at the table. 0 means you are dying. 

- The down player can do an epic attack and automatically die after the epic attack.
- The fallen player will use GRIT as the death timer. This will give enough time for other players to patch or heal the fallen player.
- If the PC is not handled with a medical kit or magic, the PC will roll a Saved By a Bone (Death Save).

## Saved By A Bone

A player may roll a Saved by a Bone. This is our death save. If the player rolls, a 1 BL is not allowed.

- If you roll a 1, this means the PC is dead.
- 2-4, they are still bleeding out. The **GM will roll a d2 death timer**. 
- 5 they save. 5 the PC will get up with (x) amount GRIT as their HP.
- 6 the PC will get (x)*2 GRIT as their HP.

## Weapon Tag

- **Small:** Takes 1 slot and does 1 dmg + (MIGHT/INSIGHT)
- **Medium:** Takes 2 slots and does 2 dmg + (MIGHT/INSIGHT)
- **Great:** Takes 3 slots and does 3 dmg + (MIGHT/INSIGHT)

If not rolling for damage, the player will use their MIGHT/INSIGHT as a bonus.

### Optional Rule

PC can roll for damage instead of automatically doing damage. They will use the damage bonus instead of the attribute points.

> **Designer Notes:**
>
> - This is up to the GM and their players. Some players will like the automatic or rolling damage.
> - I would have this conversation before starting the game. If is a group of new players whom they never played TTRPG go with automatic, or if they like rolling for damage try it and adapt the game according to the style of the table.

## Damage Bonuses

- Small weapons: Roll 2d6 **lowest result**, then add damage bonus
- Medium weapons: Roll 1d6 + **damage bonus**
- Great weapons: Roll 2d6 takes the **highest result** and then adds your damage bonus.

The PC damage bonus will be half of their attributes rounded down.

- 1 point in attributes =  **0 bonus**
- 2 points in attributes = **1 bonus**
- 3 points in attributes = **1 bonus**
- 4 points in attributes = **2 bonus**
- 5 points in attributes = **2 bonus**
- 6 points in attributes = **3 bonus**

## Resting

When players are in a somewhat safe area, with no active encounter:

- The players can recover **1d6+GRIT** health and regain Bones Luck to three. Players need to rest in a safe place with uninterrupted sleep whenever they eat a ration.
- The players can eat rations and use their waterskin; this is taking a breather before going forward to their next stop. A player must declare a **Breather**; this way, the GM can allow the players to use their rations with a short rest. When the PCs do this, they can roll 1d3+GRIT health and will not recover Bones Luck.

- **Leather:** The player rolls without burden against Attack rolls while wearing this armor. Cost: _15 GP, 3 Quality, 1 slot_, -d2 _damage reduction_ when hit. 
- **Plate Mail:** While wearing this armor, the player will roll with burden against **Attack, Acrobatic, and stealth checks** and a **boost** on Mobility Save rolls. Cost: _60 GP, 7 Quality, 5 slots_, -d6 _damage reduction_ when hit. 
- **Shield:** Cost 10 gp **-1 damage** when being held, _1 quality, 1 slot_. The PC can ignore all damage from one attack but the shield breaks.

## BareBones Spell Casting

Magic is accessible to anyone with points in their Essence attribute. To cast a spell, roll your Essence attribute; if you roll a 5 or 6, the spell will take effect. However, be cautious of those fumble rolls, as they may have unintended consequences for the spell-caster. If player fails to cast their spell, the gm can afflict damage or make the pressence of the players known to the guards or monsters. Keep in mind that magic is dangerous! Only a _**brave or a foolish**_ soul may try this mysterious arcane power without considering its effects or repercussions. **Magic-User** will roll **_d3+Essence_** every morning to determine how many times they can cast their spells. 

The GM may allow spells from other OSR books or resources. Conversion will be necessary to align with the mechanics of BareBones RPG.

## Spell Mishap

This rule operates similarly to Critical or Fumble rules. When rolling dice for an ESSENCE check, if both 1s and 6s appear on the same roll, the outcome is determined as follows:

- If there are more 6s than 1s, the roll is considered a success.
- If there are more 1s than 6s, the roll is ruled a fumble.

**Magic is a perilous power, only to be tampered with by the bravest or most foolish**. The GM can consult the following table when multiple ones are rolled on a single ESSENCE roll. Alternatively, the GM may inflict damage on the spell caster equal to the number of rolled 1s against the casting player's Hit Points or Essence.
